        <p className='introp'>Panic! At The Disco is an American rock band known for its eclectic style that spans pop-punk, emo, and baroque pop. Formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2004, the band originally consisted of Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Jon Walker, and Brendon Urie. Emerging from the mid-2000s emo and pop-punk scene, they gained widespread recognition with their debut album, A Fever You Canâ€™t Sweat Out, which featured the hit single "I Write Sings Not Tragedies." Known for their theatrical live performances and genre-blending sound, Panic! At The Disco has evolved significantly over the years. With Urie as the sole remaining original member, the band has continued to innovate, incorporating elements of pop, rock, and electronic music into their dynamic and ever-evolving style.</p>
